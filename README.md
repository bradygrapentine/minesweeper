This is a minesweeper clone that I built during my time at Suncoast Developers Guild. I had a lot of fun exploring the interplay between JS and CSS during this assignment.

Try it out! If you can't beat it, you can close the tab and come back later. My clone will start you right where you left off because I've got a little local storage built into this application.

Let me know if you can win on Hard mode. It's a challenge.

 <!-- Fix the margin between the main and the board in CSS so that it only adjusts when more squares are added -->

In this assignment, you will communicate with a back-end API server to create the user-interface for a Minesweeper clone. It might help to familiarize yourself with the game if you have never played it.

<!-- Objectives

- Understand how state drives changes to an interface in React
- Respond to user events in React
- Understand and use REST APIs
- Use React lifecycle methods
- Understand and interpret API documentation
- Use fetch or axios to perform POST request or

<!-- Requirements:

- Read over the documentation for the API we will be using: https://minesweeper-api.herokuapp.com/

- You will need to interpret the response and render a graphical user interface.
- The API results include an array of arrays (two-dimensional array). These represent rows and columns.
- Consider using flexbox, grid, or an old-fashioned table to organize these.

- Use Insomnia to test out the API. Try "playing" games with the API. This will help you understand the "flow" of the game via the API.

<!-- Explorer Mode:

- Create a button to create a new game. Use the animated gif above as a user interface guide. Do at least that much, but also feel free to have fun.

<!-- DONE

- Left-clicking a cell performs the check action

<!-- DONE

- Right/secondary clicking a cell performs the flag action

<!-- DONE

When the game status changed to won or lost a victory or failure message - Do not use alert for this. Update the user interface.

<!-- DONE

- Style the cells appropriately.

<!-- DONE

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->

<!-- Adventure Mode:

Before creating the game, allow the user to choose: - Easy, Medium, or Hard mode.

<!-- DONE

Have fun with the styling. Make it your own.

<!-- DONE

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->

<!-- Epic Mode:

--------------------------------------Learn how to use localStorage API to store data in - the browser. Use this to allow the user to close - the browser window and come back to a game already - in progress.

<!-- DONE
